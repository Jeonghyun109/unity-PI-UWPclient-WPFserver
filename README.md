Pocking Interaction

This branch is a branch for developing 'Poking Interaction' research.
Now, I am working on additional experiment.
The experiment is divided into 2 sub-experiment, 'scenario-1' and 'scenario-2'.

##scenario-1
Scenario-1 has two states, 'preview' & 'select'.
The experimental interface consists of 9 buttons (3*3) and experiment instruction text.
The experiment has 99 trials, and for each trial, the user should find out corresponding button to the instruction text.

##scenario-2
Scenario-2 has three states, 'preview', 'select(pick)', 'drop'.
Thus, it requires for special haptic feedback design to distinguish each state.
